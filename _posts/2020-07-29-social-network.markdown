Okay, here the question?

-Social network is time killer?

-Yest, it is.

---

In past week, I tried to quit social network. Finally, I almost 'disconnected' myself from social network.

No, no wait. You can tell me 'You are lying and still using Telegram'. Wait a minute... Let me explain.

Right now, I am not checking new messages every 5 minute. And this helps me to focus on primary tasks.

How I quit social network websites? Here tips which are worked for me:
 - For first days, delete application on mobile phone and try login in into accounts in browser.
 - After sometime, you can deactivate your FB, Instagram accounts(which you can restore in future)
 - Log out accounts and delete apps in computer

Maybe you are thinking about if I quite those social network, I can not reach super important news.

Okay, here funny fact: I tried not using Telegram for a week. Then, I login again and got all trash conversation, messages which are not super important.

Happy life.
