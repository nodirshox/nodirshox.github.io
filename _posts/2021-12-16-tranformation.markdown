Today, I want to share my story of how I started my professional career. I hope you will enjoy reading and get some advice for yourself.

# TL;DR

Always try to go to a challenging environment and places to grow up.

# Background info

I was a student at Inha University in Tashkent. My Major is in computer science. I and my friends studied mostly theoretical computer science courses like Algorithms, Databases, Networking. Learning those subjects with interest was hard. Because there were no attractive practices like coding and building website. 

Then, I learned UI/UX design for myself and practiced 2-3 places for 2 years. Then, I was not super happy being a designer and tried to find spheres in programming. I learned some frontend: HTML, CSS, and some JS. So I felt lost and see different paths for a future career, but could not decide which one truly become.

# 2020, Summer

As you remember, those times Covid cases increased and the government prohibited going outside. I was busy at my home(Jizzax) and doing some side projects and learning a programming language.

My friend from the university called me and suggested joining the company as a Backend developer. At this moment I have a little experience in NodeJS. I agreed and prepared to go to an offline office job in Tashkent.

# 2020, September ~ 2021, June

A company called [Udevs](https://t.me/udevs_news){:target="_blank"}. The team was young and energetic. I joined as a backend developer on a new project. I don't have much experience building APIs, but joining a new project is helped me a lot. During 10 months was challenging and learned the following:

- Working as a Team by using Agile methods build product features
- How to communicate with clients as a developer
- How to transform a business idea into an application
- Coding different languages and technologies
- Collaborated with dev team: Designer, Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps, PM
- Managed some time product dev team

As you can see, without working for a company, it is hard to improve those skills as a self-taught programmer. I definitely suggest joining "Udevs" someone who is interested in the IT-sphere.

In this period, I was still a student and our classes were fully online. This means, I worked full-time in an offline job and did homework evenings. I also got a higher GPA by studying online and got valuable experience by working offline. It is like a win-win condition.

# 2021, July - now

I tried to find other places for more challenging places and I chose [Epam Systems](https://epam.com/){:target="_blank"}. I joined as Junior Software Engineer. In the future, I will continue to share my updates.

# Sum up

To conclude, I suggest to you always find people and an environment for your growth. In challenging times, do not go back or give up. It is temporary, it somehow benefits you in future.  Share a post with your friends.
